This mini project is to demonstrate my bash scripting skills using Makefile. The "Makefile" in the shell executes the object files ".o" and ".c" then generates the executable file called "calcmarks" (which is just a file containing unformatted charaters). Then run "Makefile update_vn" in the shell. It will update the versions of all object files and the Makefile itself
