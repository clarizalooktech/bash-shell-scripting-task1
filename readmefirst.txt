###Clariza's Notes####
Steps to execute the files
0. There is an existing "Makefile" file in the current "final_tsk1" folder. 
1. Extract calcmarks.zip manually, except for "Makefile" file
2. After extracting without the "MakeFile" file from the calcmarks.zip, Now call the "Makefile" by typing "make" or "Makefile" in the shell to generate the executable file called "calcmarks" which is the project name
3. Then run "Makefile update_vn" in the shell. It will update the versions of all C files and the Makefile itself
